### About Me

Hello and welcome to my Github page! I study maths at the University of Göttingen, am incoming for the degree in statistics at ETH Zürich and like to write open source for fun. Sometimes programming is also my job, either employed by places like the Bosch Group and my university or as an independant grant recipient. Some favourite topics of mine include silly CLI applications, statistics, alignment, iterpretability and learning languages. Feel free to reach out or contribute!
