### About the Developer

Hello and welcome to my Github page. I have a little professional experience with Python and C#, but this is for personal projects done purely for fun. I like silly CLI applications, interdisciplinary software development, quantitative finance, learning languages and simulating things. Feel free to reach out or contribute!
